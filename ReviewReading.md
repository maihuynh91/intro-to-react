After reading the Official React documentation by Facebook, I found some interesting things:
	Render() method takes input data and returns what to display. 
    JSX (JavaScript XML) is optional and used to add XML syntax to JS. 
    Input data can be accessed via <this.props>
    Component can maintain internal state data by using <this.state>
    A Component uses external plugins such as “Remakable”.
